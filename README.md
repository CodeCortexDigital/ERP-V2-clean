# ERP-V2 — School & Institute Management System

A full-stack, multi-tenant school/ERP management platform with a **React + TypeScript (Vite/Tailwind)** frontend and a **Django REST (Python)** backend featuring role-based portals, real-time WebSockets, finance & payroll, and AI/ML-powered analytics.

## Features

- **Role-based portals** — Admin, Teacher/Employee, Student, and Parent dashboards with RBAC-scoped navigation and route guards.
- **Academics** — classes, sections, subjects, curriculum (syllabus → topic → sub-topic), timetable & period scheduling, homework, class tests.
- **Students & Teachers** — full lifecycle management: admission, profiles, history timelines, promotions, ID cards, letters, login management.
- **Exams & Results** — exam hub, marks entry, result cards, mark-sheets, grade scales, report cards, admit cards.
- **Attendance** — student & staff attendance with bulk entry, reports, and facial-recognition embeddings.
- **Finance & Payroll** — fee structure, invoices, installments, discounts, late fees, payment gateways (JazzCash/Easypaisa), salary generation and slips.
- **Communication** — in-app chat, SMS/WhatsApp broadcast (Meta Graph API), notifications, announcements.
- **Analytics & AI** — executive dashboard with real-time KPIs, risk scoring, performance prediction, anomaly detection, and a voice-enabled AI assistant.
- **Real-time** — WebSocket KPI/attendance/notification broadcasts.
- **Multi-tenancy** — tenant resolution via header/subdomain/session with per-tenant data scoping.

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the full feature breakdown.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite for quick local dev)
- Redis (optional for dev — required for Celery/WebSockets in production)

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  |  macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

On Windows you can also run `setup.bat` for a scripted fresh install (venv, deps, migrations, superuser, sample data).

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Configuration

Copy the example env files and fill in your values:

- Backend: `.env.example` → `.env` (database, Redis/Celery, email, S3, WhatsApp, payment gateways, JWT, feature flags)
- Frontend: `frontend/.env.example` → `frontend/.env.local` (API/WS URLs, Firebase, app settings)

**Never commit real secrets** — keep production credentials out of the repository.

### API Docs

Versioned OpenAPI docs are auto-generated with drf-spectacular:

- `/api/v1/schema/swagger-ui/`
- `/api/v1/schema/redoc/`

## Deployment

The backend (Django + PostgreSQL + Redis + Celery + WebSockets) cannot run on static-only hosts. Use one of the prepared options:

### Recommended — Vercel (frontend) + Oracle Cloud Free ARM (backend)

Fully free, always-on, no expiry:

- **Frontend** → Vercel Hobby (static SPA, `frontend/vercel.json`)
- **Backend** → Oracle Cloud Always Free ARM VM running `docker compose up -d --build` (Django/daphne + PostgreSQL + Redis + Celery, all self-contained)

Step-by-step instructions: **[deploy/oracle-setup.md](deploy/oracle-setup.md)**

### Option A — Self-hosted with Docker (full stack, recommended)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set SECRET_KEY and DB_PASSWORD
docker compose up -d --build
```

Starts PostgreSQL, Redis, Django (daphne/ASGI), Celery worker + beat, and the Nginx-served frontend on port 80. Media and collected static files live in shared Docker volumes.

### Option B — Render blueprint

Import this repo into [Render](https://render.com) as a Blueprint (`render.yaml`). It provisions PostgreSQL, Redis, the Django web service, two Celery workers, and the frontend static site automatically. After first deploy, set `VITE_API_URL` on the frontend to `https://<your-backend>.onrender.com/api`.

### Option C — Vercel (frontend) + backend elsewhere

The SPA can be deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) using the included `frontend/vercel.json`. Host the Django backend separately (Render/Railway/VPS) and set `VITE_API_URL` to its URL during the Vercel build.

> Production checklist: set a strong `SECRET_KEY`, restrict `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and CORS to your real domains, enable HTTPS, and set `USE_S3_STORAGE=true` for media once you have S3/R2 credentials.

## Testing

```bash
# Backend (pytest + coverage)
cd backend
pytest tests/ --cov=services --cov=auth_api

# Frontend (Vitest)
cd frontend
npm run test
npm run lint
```

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs backend/frontend tests, linting (flake8, ESLint), type checking (mypy), security audits (bandit, safety, npm audit), migration safety checks, and build artifacts on push/PR to `main`, `staging`, and `develop`.
